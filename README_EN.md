# ShiyunRL: Automatic parameter adjustment reinforcement learning framework based on PyTorch

Welcome to ShiyunRL, an automatic parameter adjustment reinforcement learning framework based on PyTorch, which aims to empower researchers and enthusiasts in the field of artificial intelligence. Our goal in creating ShiyunRL is to provide a reinforcement learning algorithm framework with low entry threshold, fast learning and strong extensibility, which is convenient for developing and testing single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms and quickly producing results in academia and industry.

## Main features:

- **Gymnasium interface specification**: Adapts to any environment that conforms to the gym interface specification, including third-party environments and custom environments developed according to the gym interface
- **Modular design**: The code is loosely coupled, and any module can be added and modified, which is convenient for learning and scientific research innovation.
- **Genetic algorithm**: Integrate the genetic algorithm framework to automatically optimize 9 hyperparameters and train results with one click.
- **Scalability and extensibility**: Supports arbitrary modification of the network structure, such as adding convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, self-attention mechanisms, etc. Supports innovation by integrating course learning and imitation learning.
- **Configuration file**: Use json file to save and read the hyperparameter optimization range, and use yaml file to save and read the optimal configuration.
- **Discrete action space**: Currently supports sac and ppo algorithms on discrete action space. Reinforcement learning enthusiasts are welcome to contribute other algorithms that meet the interface of this project to this project.
